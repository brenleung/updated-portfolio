# An updated portfolio..
After a full year of learning fullstack development, I decided it would be best to re-create my portfolio showing what I have now learned.
This time, I am choosing to showcase it on React and making it viewable on all screen sizes! (something that was not taken account for in
my previous updated portfolio).

As I continue this project during the summer months, I will update this document as I see fit.
